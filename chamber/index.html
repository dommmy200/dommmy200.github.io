                        Consultation is a process of seeking and providing information and advice,
                        exchanging views, and discussing problems in an atmosphere of mutual respect and
                        trust. To be effective, the process must be motivated by a commitment of both sides to
                        sharing information, to listening to the opinions and observations of the other, and to
                        working together to solve problems and resolve differences.<br>
                        Any exchange of views, which leads to a more informed decision, is
                        productive for all parties<br>
                        Consultation may reveal information on issues (including things such as local traffic or flooding conditions) or opportunities that are important to your proposal as business but that you might not be aware of.<br>

                    <p>Neither ship, rail, nor air transport can compete with the flexibility provided by road transport. In spite of rising fuel prices, transporting goods by road continues to be a competitive strategy. Today’s geolocation systems allow us to track the location of vehicles and their shipment in real time and throughout the entire route. The road network’s extension allows the delivery of goods to anywhere in the world, immediately, at any given time. In the event of a breakdown or an accident—and if the cargo is in good state—replacing the vehicle with another to cover the planned route can be done easily and fast. </p>
