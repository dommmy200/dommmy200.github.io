            <p>Rule of Thirds</p>
            <p>Staak</p>
            <a href="https://www.staak.co.uk/">Staak Studio</a>
            <img src="../lesson02/images/rule-of-3rd.jpg" alt="Staak Studio Web Page">
            <p class="p-top">The main focus of the rule of thirds is to create a sense of flow due
                to its asymmetry. This image is positioned to occupy the four points 
                of the intersection created by dividing the viewport into 9 cells 
                with 4 intersection points at the center of the viewport. This webpage 
                has successfully positioned the main attraction about these intersections.</p>

        <div class="main middle">
            <p>Visual Hierarchy</p>
            <p>Apple</p>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/ng/imac/">Apple-iMac</a>
            <img src="../lesson02/images/visual-hierarchy.jpg" alt="Apple iMac Home Page">
            <p class="p-middle">The visual hierarchy principle ensures that the visitor does not have a 
                hard time figuring out where and what the interest on the page is. By laying 
                out elements logically and strategically, the visitor is guided to take a 
                desired action. The iMac is shown bigger than the other elements making it 
                more prominent than the other items.</p>

        <div class="main bottom">
            <p>White Space</p>
            <p>Flux</p>
            <a href="https://www.flux-academy.com/blog/the-importance-of-whitespace-in-design-with-examples">Flux-Academy</a>
            <img src="../lesson02/images/flux-academy-white-space.jpg" alt="Photo Example of Whitespace ">
            <p class="p-bottom">The Whitespace principle is mainly implemented with the "Micro Whitespace", 
                which refers to small instances of empty space, such as that between letters, 
                lines of text, and grid images and, the "Macro Whitespace", which refers to 
                the larger areas of empty space in a design that form the margins to the left 
                and right of blog post amd articles. This webpage has exemplified it by 
                leaving both micro and macro white spaces appropriately.</p>
